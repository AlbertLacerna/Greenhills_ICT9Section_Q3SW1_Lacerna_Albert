		<div class="col-xl-9 text-secondary"> Now, The bounter hunter when first meeting him in the show I found him a bit rough around the edges the way he talk with people with almost no emotions from the first ep not knowing what character development could happened. He is also the mandalorian that was in the the synopsis. Which he became a hunter by being cared for by a mandalorian as a foundling under him. Which is why he gives full loyalty of being one. He was tasked with giving Grogu to the dark side but soon changes his mine when he knew something is up and saved him out of the lab. But now was tasked by one of his people to get him with his people. </div>
